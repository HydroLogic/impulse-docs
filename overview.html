<p>  Impulse is a library for building dynamic physics based interactions,
with a focus on mobile web.</p>
<h2>How is this different from jquery animate, velocity.js, etc?</h2>
<p>  Most animation libraries animate from one state to another over a fixed
period of time.  If you want non-linear movement you pass in an easing
function, which modifies the original path in the same way every time.</p>
<p>  Impulse takes a different approach.  Instead of a duration, Impulse instead
takes an initial velocity, and simulates the animation based on that.  This
small change produces a difference experiences.  Instead of static animations
that feel awkward and stiff, Impulse animations feel smooth and fluid.</p>
<p>  Animations flow smoothly from user interactions.  When a user swipes an
element, moves at the velocity of their swipe.</p>
<h2>How is this different from famo.us?</h2>
<p>  Famo.us is a huge framework that tries to do everything for you. It tries to
do away with the browser&#39;s layout engine, in favor of converting everything
into a hardware accelerated render layer and controlling everything itself.
Impulse is a much small library that provides physics based animations and
interactions.</p>
