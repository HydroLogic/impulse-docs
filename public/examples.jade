      You can use your mouse, but these demo's are much
      cooler on your phone or tablet!

  .example.chat-heads
    h2 Chat Heads

    :markdown

      A "chat heads" chat overlay, much like facebook's. This demo uses the
      `interaction`, `spring`, and `attachSpring` methods.

      There is a main chat head, which you drag around, and then each
      additional head is attached to the next, kindof like a linked list!

  .example.pulldown-menu
    h2 pulldownMenu

    :markdown

      A pull down menu, with a feel like the ios 7 notifications pulldown-menu.
      Accelerates down and bounces as if pulled by gravity, and
      springs closed.

  .example.simulated-scrolling
    h2 Simulated Scroll
    .warning
      h3 ACHTUNG!
      :markdown
        Unless your situation is extreme, you should probably not use
        simulated scrolling in a real app, since there are A TON of optimizations
        that modern mobile browsers do to give you the silkiest, smoothest
        possible scrolling experience.

    :markdown

      Simulated scrolling with inertia, deceleration, overscroll
      and bounce, in about 30 lines.

  .example.oridomi
    h2 Oridomi Cover

    :markdown

      This example uses the awesome
      [oridomi](https://github.com/dmotz/oriDomi) library as a custom
      renderer.

      Normally oridomi elements don't animate open and closed on swipe.
      We used impulse to add the ability to open and close the "cover"
      with just a few lines in Impulse.

  .example.bounce-scroll
    h2 Bouncy Scrolling

    .notice
      h3 BETA

      This demo is using an experimental optimization branch of impulse, and doesn't
      perform very well on a lot of devices.

    :markdown
      Taking the previous example to the extreme, we added bouncy scrolling,
      similar to iOS 7 Messages App bouncy scroll.  This example may be slower
      on older devices, due to the number of compositor RenderLayers (each
      message), as well as the number of springs that need to be simulated.
